This is something for me to work on when I'm feeling bored or frustrated. It'll probably be boring and frustrating, but at least it's MY boring and frustrating and not someone else's

This is not so I can get a different/betterpaying job
This is not for my kids
This is not for my wife
This is for me (and that's just fine)
This is not perfect, nor will it ever be (and that's just fine)
This may, or may not, be entertaining (and that's just fine)
This may, or may not, be self indulgent drivel (and that's just fine)

You don't have to be perfect
You don't have to get it right on the first try
You are trying your hardest, which looks different every day, and that's just fine.
